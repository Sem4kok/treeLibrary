TreeLibrary is a library of trees needed in development. It provides an excellent interface for interacting with binary trees and is easily extensible for your needs.

Tree Library is being actively developed by SPBU students. The library is currently in beta, as we want to get feedback from users and test a few promising ideas. The library API is quite stable, but we do not exclude that we will make small changes to it.
